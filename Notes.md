# Some Notes #

-Good C++ programmin. COde reasonably commented.
-Good the idea of using namespaces
-Spai preconditioner is not working. Have you tried to understand why? Where have you got the info on SPAI? There is clearly something wrong.
- Diagonal preconditioner is just a scaling of the matrix, normally doeas very little.

Coding is formally ok, but the results a bit disappointing. 



# Minor stuff #
- For a vector you could have specialised a matrix with just one column.
