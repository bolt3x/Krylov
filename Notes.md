# Some Notes #

-Good C++ programmin. COde reasonably commented.
-Good the idea of using namespaces
-Diagonal preconditioner is just a scaling of the matrix, normally deas very little. One could try with a symmetric
Gauss siedel.
- More daring tests could have been tried!, with larger matrices.
- Some parmeters for the tests (like the method used, preconditioner and the matrix file name) could have been read from a file. a bit more work
but at least we would have easier way of running the tests.



# Minor stuff #
- For a vector you could have specialised a matrix with just one column.
